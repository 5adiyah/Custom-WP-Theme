# 10up Front End Engineering Technical Challenge

This is my custom wordpress theme created as a submission for the 10up Front End engineering challenge. This project demonstrates my ability to architect a mobile layout given only desktop designs.  The project showcases a responsive, accessible, and future proofed web page layout implemented from this design.

## **Project Overview**

- **Time Spent**: Approximately 2.5 evenings (6-7 hours total).

  - **Responsiveness**: I've implemented a fully responsive layout built using just pure CSS.
  - **Accessibility**: I've added an accessible navigation, keyboard-friendly interactions including tabbing and focus states, and ARIA attributes and labels.
